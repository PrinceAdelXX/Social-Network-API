# Social Network API
  
## Description
The Social Network is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list

## Technologies Used  
* Express.js
* Mongoose
* NodeJS 

## Installation
Note: users are expected to know some JavaScript

* Install NodeJS
* Install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for route testing
* You should also have pulled this repository at this point (we'll get to Node in second)
* On your project directory, you will initialize npm by typing ```npm init```
* After that command runs a series of processes, you're ready to use npm.
* Type ```npm i``` on the root of the repo you've just pulled. This will fetch all dependencies used to get this app to work.
* At this point, the project is ready. Let's now run ```npm start``` on your terminal (make sure you're on the root directory where the 'server.js' file is located)
* You can now test some of the routes as shown in the video below on either Insomnia or Postman
